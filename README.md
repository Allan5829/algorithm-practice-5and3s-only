# algorithm-practice-5and3s-only

This repository will contain my solution for Fives and Threes Only at https://edabit.com/challenge/2aRggQCd8XFHtdtBD Instructions copied below for convenience.

Starting with either 3 or 5 and given these operations:

add 5
multiply by 3
You should say if it is possible to reach the target number n.

Examples
only5and3(14) ➞ true
// 14 = 3*3 + 5

only5and3(25) ➞ true
// 25 = 5+5+5+5+5

only5and3(7) ➞ false
// There exists no path to the target number 7

Notes
You can solve this problem by recursion or algebra.
